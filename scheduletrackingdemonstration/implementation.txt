Schedule tracking Demo Implementation

Controllers:
The demo defines its own controllers and a simple view. The page is located under:
<motech-platform-address>/module/scheduletracking-demo/enroll/scheduleTracking

Via the webpage, you can register patients, that will be added to the test database and enroll patients to the
Demo Concept Schedule.

The demo implementation also registers listeners, one to handle Commcare forms and another to handle schedule-tracking
milestones.

The first one will listen to all form events, sent by Commcare (indicating that CommCare has received a form
and managed to parse it properly). The demo listener will check the form CommCare notifies about, via the form name.
The listener expects either Registration, Encounter or Enrollment form. The demo listener will use its own validators
to verify the fields of the forms have expected values. If the values are correct, the demo will attempt to perform
actions on OpenMRS patient (of the given MOTECH Id, passed in the CommCare form).

The second listener handles milestone events sent by the schedule-tracking module.

The parent pom was modified to include the campaign demo project as a module
